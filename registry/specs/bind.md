## bind

- Begins a two Item Scope
- The first Item is a data type that describes how to continue parsing and construct the second Item
- The composition of the first Item translates into a composition of the following parse operations:
  - varint - consumes one varint
  - item - parses one Item by default rules
  - block_size - consumes a fixed number of blocks
  - block_variable - consumes one varint for number of blocks to consume, bias by 1, no zero lengths
  - bit_size - consumes a fixed number of bits from a non-varint block
  - bit_variable - consumes one varint for number of bits to consume, bias by 1, no zero lengths
  - text - implicitly begins a variable length Scope using the [text symbol list](../text.md)
  - array - consumes one varint for array length, if zero begin array_stream
  - array_stream - consumes one varint for array length and length number of items repeatedly until a zero length ends the array
  - map - parse operations of each child Item are run in sequence
  - choice - consumes one varint for choice selection, continues according to choice
  - choice_index - consumes one varint for choice selection, continues according to choice
  - choice_bit_size - consumes a fixed number of bits from a non-varint block
  - varint_plus_block - consumes one varint and one block
  - none - consumes nothing
- After the second Item is parsed, the parse operation of the bind Scope will be: item
