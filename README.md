# DBUF (Dense Binary Universal Format)

DBUF is a data specification forming the basis of a community of software and tools. It is a self-describing binary format where symbols compose to form a sophisticated type system.

## Ideals

- **Enable new ways of working together** - Fragmentation is a chronic barrier in the pursuit of software that meets people's needs. Creating interoperable foundations can unlock new freedoms and creativity.

- **Long term approach to design** - Conquering fragmentation means tackling every genre of software. It is a monumental task with several "Chicken-and-egg" style obstacles. It will take very careful design that can't be rushed. Nevertheless there is always a way to start small and gain traction without comprising long term potential. 

- **Maximum potential for optimization** - Not everyone cares about performance, but to build the strongest ecosystem, the coalition must include those that do care about performance. Careful design around progressive optimization is key so that optimal and non-optimal solutions can interoperate. High optimization is also necessary to create cost incentives to displace legacy technologies.
